## Notes
- There is a dependency for [StyleX](https://stylexjs.com/), this was used for `/resume`. I recently heard of StyleX and wanted to play around with it.
- StyleX/vite configured loosely using instructions provided [here](https://medium.com/@huseyinsalmansoftdev/react-stylex-vite-npm-db9be1e5c5c6).
- Routing code graciously copied from [here](https://dev.to/franciscomendes10866/file-based-routing-using-vite-and-react-router-3fdo).
